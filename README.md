# Hi, I’m Kaushik Jayaprakash 👋  

🚀 AI / ML Engineer | Data Engineer | Cloud & Distributed Systems  
🎓 MS Information Systems @ Northeastern University (GPA 3.6)  
📍 Boston, MA  

I build **production-grade AI systems** that combine  
**Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Cloud Infrastructure** —  
from multi-agent GenAI platforms to scalable data pipelines and explainable AI systems.

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- 🧠 **Healthcare Digital Twin (AI/ML Intern @ Dox Health)**  
  Building an explainable, guard-railed conversational AI that translates longitudinal health data  
  (QHA, BP, FBG, BMI, RHR, sleep, steps, nutrition) into grounded insights.

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent GenAI Systems**  
  Designing LangChain / LangGraph based agents for reasoning across  
  structured data (Snowflake) and unstructured data (RAG pipelines).

- ☁️ **Scalable Data Engineering Pipelines**  
  Optimizing ingestion, transformation, and analytics workflows using  
  Spark, Kafka, Airflow, and cloud-native infrastructure.
